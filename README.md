## Features

 - [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) for fetching data! The most awesome part of the project!
 - ES6/ES2015 with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
 - React data container for the [Apollo Client](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/) 
 - Integrating predictable state container [Redux](http://redux.js.org) with Apollo
 - Hot reloading using [react-transform-hmr](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr)
 - Development and production bundling by [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
 - [CSSNext](http://cssnext.io/): use of official W3C syntax of the future CSS
 - Transforming styles with JS plugins by [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/)
 - [Wow.js](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/) for CSS animations
 - [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) for resolving [layout fatigue](http://blog.karenmenezes.com/2014/apr/13/floats-inline-block-or-display-table-or-flexbox/) and making the app responsive (open the app in desktop, mobile, whatever...). Doesn't work on IE 9, but it should not be a problem nowadays. See [browsers usage](http://caniuse.com/usage-table).
 - [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules): say goodbye to global scope in CSS and most of conflicts
 - Linting both JS and CSS, respectively by: [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) and [Stylelint](http://stylelint.io/)
 

 - Production Mode in progress due to [this issue](https://github.com/apollostack/react-apollo/issues/250)
